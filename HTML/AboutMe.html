            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio. I'm a recent qualified Wed Developer but all my life I've been into Sports and Fitness Industry, working as a Personal Trainer, Nutritionist and most recently for the past 2 years as a Fitness Manager/Head Coach. I've decided to enroll into web development because as a kid everytime I've seen something related to this it would amaze me and I would be curious about it, as well due to my creativity and the different way I always look into things in general. I find it relatively easy to do certain tasks that others find hard, like putting stuff together. I tend to learn quite fast on job as I'm doing things. Constantly looking at learning and improving my skills. I love challange, I feel if I'm not being challenged I'm not personally growing or progressing, so I feel this will be and excellent and fantastic step/opportunity for me and my new career, as a Web Developer you will never know evertything as there are so many areas/languages to explore and learn at all times.
